# simple_postmark

SimplePostmark makes it easy to send mails via [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com)â„¢ using Rails 3's ActionMailer.
SimplePostmark is inspired by [postmark-gem](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-gem), but unfortunately postmark-gem forced to me to use non-standard Rails calls like `postmark_attachments`. SimplePostmark uses the standard Rails 3's ActionMailer syntax to send your emails via Postmark.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/haihappen/simple_postmark.png)](http://travis-ci.org/haihappen/simple_postmark)

Tested against Ruby versions `1.9.2`, `1.9.3`, `ruby-head` and Rails versions `3.0.x`, `3.1.x`, `3.2.x`, `master` (upcoming Rails `4.0.0`).

If you are still using Ruby `1.8.7` or `Ruby Enterprise Edition` with Rails 3, you can use the backported version of this gem called [simple_postmark18](https://github.com/haihappen/simple_postmark/tree/ruby18).

## Installation

In your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :production do
  gem 'simple_postmark'
end
```

In your `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :simple_postmark
config.action_mailer.simple_postmark_settings = { api_key: '********-****-****-****-************' }
```

## Usage

Just use your standard Rails 3 Mailer:

```ruby
class NotificationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def notification
    mail(to: 'ted@himym.tld', from: 'barney@himym.tld', subject: "I'm your bro!") do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

And of course you can use standard attachment calls and [Postmark's tags](http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-build.html#message-format):

```ruby
class NotificationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def notification
    attachments['thebrocode.pdf'] = File.read('thebrocode.pdf')
  
    mail(to: 'ted@himym.tld', from: 'barney@himym.tld', subject: "I'm your bro!", tag: 'with-attachment') do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```
